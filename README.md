# KMUTT-CPE100-2017-1
Nathaphop's work from KMUTT CPE 100 class.

Note that Description file in each folder is the the latest update. It could cause code doesn't work as the description file.
Because it is a description file that I can derived from [windu.cpe.kmutt.ac.th](windu.cpe.kmutt.ac.th)

## Command
You can go through each directory and then use these commands to run the code.

### GCC Compiler
`gcc -o filename.c filename` and then `./filename`.

### Makefile
In some lab/project, it already has `MAKEFILE`. You can use only

`make` to compile all .c file. Then find the execute file and use command `./filename`.
